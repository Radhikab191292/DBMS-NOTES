STORED PROCEDURE
__________________
we write once a complex query and use them for multiple times the same query
stored procedure contains multiple sql statements that can be executed in a single unit
So if you have an SQL query that you write over and over again, save it as a stored procedure, and then just call it to execute it.
we can pass the parameters to the procedure

BENIFITS
Reusability
Security
Easier maintainance

INDEX
------------
type
single_colum index
composite index
unique index

allowing database to find the rows very quickly
improves the speed of data retrieval
fast execution
time efficieny
indexes require additional storage slow down DML operations.
 query
create index sal_ind on employee (salary asc); 

VIEWS
----------
virtual table
efficient way of accessing secured way of accessing
no physical existence
it is used for simple way of accessing the data
it is for security: in table the user given the completer access if we create the view for that then we can not show the confidential data
views create a virtual table
Query:
create view male_date as select id,name,age from employee whre gende=male;

GRANT:
grant the permissions to users
REVOKE:
take the permissions from user

NORMALISATION
is used to reduce the redundancy and improves the data integrity
This involves dividing large tables into smaller defining relationships between them to ensure consisten
cy and avoid anomalies.

DENORMALISATION
it is the database optimisation technique which we add redundant data to one or more tables
the process of taking normalised data and making non normalised

where applied ro single rows and having applied ro groupes

CURSORS
-----------
it is used to store the data retrieve the data and manipulate the data
it is a temporary memory
It is used to fetch more than one record at a time
The cursor hold more than one row but process rows one by one
the set of rows hold by the cursor is active set
---Types---
implicit cursor
explicit cursor

TRIGGERS
---------
Triggers automatically executed when there is any changes in the database
such as insert,delete,update
it tracks the changes in the databes
ex: salary changes of employees
--adv--
Auditing
it prevents invalid transaction
prevents data consistency
